1 No special operation required on host side
2 Enter guest machine, goto /usr/src/hivemind/experiment
3 Run ./demote_setting, follow on-screen instruction
4 Once the system is configured, you can do experiments as normal
5 Reboot GUEST after each experiment session to reset machine environment, THIS IS REQUIRED (No need to reboot host)
  Reboot GUEST before applying another demote setting. The settings have side effects that requires a reboot to remove.

 

 

6 To use perf to stat EPT page walk cycle, run in GUEST:
/usr/src/hivemind/tools/perf/perf stat -e dtlb_load_misses.walk_completed,dtlb_load_misses.walk_pending,dtlb_store_misses.walk_completed,dtlb_store_misses.walk_pending,itlb_misses.walk_completed,itlb_misses.walk_pending,ept.walk_pending <command here>

 

Do NOT use perf command without path (it will say perf is not installed)

Do NOT run in host (inaccurate result + not installed)

You may add/change perf arguments at will, just keep the above mentioned stat items, especially the ept.walk_pending one.

 

 

7 To run hpcc, in GUEST:
cd ~/hivemind-benchmarks/hpcc

./hpcc.sh

Results will be sent to stdout

You may tweak the script to include perf

 

8 To run sysbench. in GUEST:
cd ~/hivemind-benchmarks/sysbench

./sysbench.sh

Results will be sent to stdout

You may tweak the script to include perf

 

9 To run microbench, in GUEST:
cd /usr/src/hivemind/experiment

gcc <options> pagewalk_lat.c

<perf command sequence> ./a.out

 

Options:

-DRUN_SEQ        Run sequential access

-DRUN_RAND        Run random access

^ Specify at lease one

 

-DMEASURE_READ        Test read latency

-DMEASURE_WRITE        Test write latency

^ Specify at least one

^ If used together, then measure roundtrip performance

 

-DENABLE_EARLY_PURGE        Clear TLB only once, before experiment start

-DENABLE_LATE_PURGE        Clear TLB before each page probe

^ Specify at will

Results will be sent to stdout

 

 

10 To analysis data:
Analysis end-to-end performance as usual (through benchmark output)

Analysis avg pagewalk cycle: ept.walk_pending / tlbmisses (calculated by pick/sum <miss_type>.walk_completed based on knowledge of workload)

It is normal that ept.walk_pending is not the same as sum(<miss_type>.walk_pending), we use the EPT one, but keep the others in case we need to analysis them later.


11 To run evaluation

cd /usr/src/hivemind/experiment

./guest_evaluation.sh <session_name_here>

 

Current configured to run redis & memcached for 3 time
